## Key Messages

### For Speculators/Traders:
"Subscribe for launch notifications. Buy early, benefit from pumps. 30% fees buy YNA."

### For Value-Aligned Holders:
"Find ideas that resonate. Hold to prove support. Build transparent map of global values."

### For YNA Investors:
"Ecosystem token. 30% of ALL token fees buy YNA. Locked 5 years. Long-term value accrual."

## Brand Voice

**Do:**
- Be direct and honest
- Focus on philosophy and meaning
- Use minimal, clean language
- Celebrate genuine commitment
- Highlight transparency

**Don't:**
- Use crypto hype language ("moon", "diamond hands")
- Make price predictions
- Overpromise features
- Spam or push aggressively
- Compromise philosophical integrity

## Twitter Launch Plan

### Pre-Launch (Day 1)
1. Create account: @notalone_you or @yournotalone or @notaloneyou
2. Profile setup:
   - Bio: "A place where beliefs gain real power. Each token = a social idea. Prove what matters to you. 🟢🔵🟣🟡🔴"
   - Header: Word carousel visual or Euler circles
   - Profile pic: 5 overlapping circles logo
3. Pin tweet: Introduction thread (see below)

### Introduction Thread Template
```
1/ We believe words are cheap. In a world of noise, only action has value.

That's why we created notalone.you — a platform where beliefs become measurable.

2/ How it works:
- Every week, we launch a token representing a social idea
- Hold the token = prove the idea matters to you
- We analyze who supports what, creating a transparent "Value Map"

3/ First token: $SOON

"The value of the present moment."

Stop postponing life. Tomorrow isn't guaranteed.

If this resonates, hold the token. Be counted.

4/ Economics:
- 30% of ALL token trading fees → buy back $YNA (ecosystem token)
- All YNA bought = locked for 5 years
- We're building for the long term, not quick flips

5/ Coming features:
- Personal wallet profiles (showcase your values)
- Find people who share your beliefs
- Global Value Map (what ideas resonate most?)
- Community governance (propose new tokens)

6/ This is not financial advice. This is philosophy you can measure.
